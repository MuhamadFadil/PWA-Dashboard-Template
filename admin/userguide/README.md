# CodeIgniter 4 User Guide

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible, and secure. 
More information can be found at the [official site](http://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable pre-built user guide for the framework.
It has been built from the 
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [the announcement](http://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-62615.html) on the forums.

## Installation & updates

`composer require codeigniter4/userguide` will install a copy
of the user guide inside your project, at
`vendor/codeigniter4/userguide`. You can then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.
