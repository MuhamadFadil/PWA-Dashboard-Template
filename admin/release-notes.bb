CAUTION: THIS FILE IS A MIX OF BBCODE & MARKDOWN... NEEDS PROOFING

CodeIgniter-4.0.0-alpha.1 launches today, after a lengthy build-up :)

Huge shoutout to Lonnie Ezell for all of his hard work getting the vision
and the core implementation in place!

This is an early pre-release of 4.0.0. It is not suitable for production!

There are several possible downloads, that you can see on the 
[url=https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha.1]release page[/url]) 

- the runnable versions as a 
[zip](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/releases/download/v4.0.0-alpha.1/CodeIgniter-4.0.0-alpha.1.zip) or a 
[tarball](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/releases/download/v4.0.0-alpha.1/CodeIgniter-4.0.0-alpha.1.tar.gz)/
- the developer versions of the framework (with contributor components) as
a [zip](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/archive/v4.0.0-alpha.1.zip) or a 
[tarball](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/archive/v4.0.0-alpha.1.tar.gz)/
- and finally the [epub](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/releases/download/v4.0.0-alpha.1/CodeIgniter-4.0.0-alpha.1.epub) version of the user guide for this release.

The release has all the major features in place, but there are still gaps
and issues. See ...

- [Bugs in the 4.0.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.0.0-alpha)
- [Things that we definitely want to see fixed before first proper release](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.0.0)
- [Features we would like to see in the initial proper release](), if possible, else the next update to it
- [Features that we are consciously deferring to later](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.1.0)

What we need now is feedback from the community ...

- What doesn't work well (raise a post in [url=https://forum.codeigniter.com/forum-27.html]CodeIgniter 4 Development[/url]).
If you have found a bug, then by all means create a new issue on the repo.
- What you think is missing (raise a post in [url=https://forum.codeigniter.com/forum-29.html]CodeIgniter 4 Feature Requests[/url])  
We will soon start the [url=https://forum.codeigniter.com/forum-33.html]candidate new feature[/url] posts, 
for those items in the feature requests forum that appear to have traction
- Problems that you are having using the release (raise a post in [url=https://forum.codeigniter.com/forum-30.html]CodeIgniter 4 Support[/url])  
Do NOT create repo issues with support questions - we are using github for bug and work package tracking

Do NOT post support questions or feature requests in response to this thread - those
will be deleted. We are trying to make the best of the
limited resources that we have!

Thank you, and ENJOY!
